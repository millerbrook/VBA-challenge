This course explores British literature from the Neoclassical Period through the present period. During the semester we will repeatedly explore three themes: the relation of literature to society; models of the nature and capacities of men and women; and innovations in literary technique. 

Literature and Society: how does literature respond to social and political conditions? How is literature viewed in relation to these conditions?

Models of the Nature and Capacities of Men and Women: What is the nature of human wants, needs, and capacities? How are men and women viewed separately and together? In relation to God, or nature, or capitalism, or some other encompassing idea or force? How does literature grant or reflect special understanding of or access to these natures, capacities, and relations?

Innovations in Literary Technique: how did writers innovate new forms of images, lines, stanzas, sentences, poems, plays, and extended prose works, like essays and novels? What meanings do these innovations convey, and what kinds of voices do they reflect?

By the end of the term you should be familiar with a wide variety of British authors, and you should have an understanding of the history of how poetry, prose, and drama changed in Britain between the 1700s and the present.

Learning Outcomes

•	Analyze themes and relate them to historical antecedents and descendants
•	Interpret how textual representations relate to historical contexts

Graded Assignments
Our work will consist of the following:
Reading Journal: 35%
Community Building and Curation: 10%
Two in-semester exams: 30% (15% each)
Final exam: 25%

Expectations: This course emphasizes reading substantially in the canon to give you a better understanding of how British literature has changed over time. We will read carefully and broadly. For poetry, you should plan re-reading individual poems several times in order to have a good initial grasp of the material. 

For every reading you will produce reading journal entries and submit them to a personal Google Doc and to a shared discussion forum. You will also read your peers’ postings, like those that seem insightful, and use them for studying for exams. 

Please treat your reading journal entries as ways of recording what’s distinctive about particular works, and as the beginning of inquiry. preparation for discussion: ask questions about what intrigues or puzzles you. Those inquiries should focus both on particular meanings and upon possible connections between texts and to contexts (the literary movements of the period or historical forces). 

In your reading journal, quote and analyze specifics from each work. I will provide guiding questions. Aim for at least a paragraph in response to each question, or about each poem or excerpt we read. For prose and drama, select specific, particularly important quotations to analyze.  You should write notes and reflections on everything you read. Reading journals will be graded based on the depth of your entries. That is, thoughtful, engaged, specific entries will receive 100%. Adequate entries will receive either 85% or 75%. Incomplete entries receive 50% or 0%. I do not provide written comments on your journals as they come in, but I’m happy to discuss your performance on the journals with you.

As you write your journals, consider exploring the following questions:
1.	What ‘close reading’ that explains the whole through the relations of individual parts can I offer?
2.	How does the content relate to the formal characteristics of the work?
3.	How are the various readings related?
4.	How does a piece relate to ideas about the purpose of literature or the nature of good literature associated with this time period?
5.	How does the piece comment on universal or historically-based aspects of human individuals and communities?

Please treat these as inspiration rather than prescription for how to complete journal entries.

In terms of length, consider the time it takes to do good analysis rather than a word count. Aim for spending time on your reading journal entries for each reading in addition to the time you spend reading. 

Note: Student work from this class may be anonymously shared by this program or UMM to assess achievement of student learning outcomes. If you do not wish your work to contribute to learning assessment, please inform the professor.

Community Building and Curation
Each week, you will contribute to highlighting and organizing insights and quotations that identity key ideas about the literature we’ve read.

Exams
Exams include short response questions and long essay questions. They test your in-depth knowledge and understanding of each work we’ve read, as well as connections between works and to contexts. You will have approximately one week to complete each exam. The due dates are available on Canvas.

The final exam is cumulative. You will compose several essay responses in which you connect works of literature with one another in relation to our course themes.
